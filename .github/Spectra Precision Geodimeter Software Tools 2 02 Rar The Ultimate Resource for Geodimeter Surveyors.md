# Spectra Precision Geodimeter Software Tools: A Review
 
Spectra Precision Geodimeter Software Tools (SP GST) is an application that allows users to upload, download and edit Geodimeter surveying data files. Geodimeter is a brand of electronic distance measurement instruments that was acquired by Spectra Precision, which was later purchased by Trimble Navigation. SP GST is useful with Geodimeter instruments and data only.
 
SP GST 2.02 is the latest version of the software, which runs on Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4 Service Pack 4, 2000 and XP. It can also be launched from Trimble Terramodel 10.61 with Geocomp Update K or later. SP GST 2.02 superseded Geodimeter Software Tools 2.01 for Windows and Geodimeter Software Tools 1.0 for DOS.

SP GST 2.02 has several features and functions, such as:
 
- Uploading and downloading data files from Geodimeter instruments via serial port or PCMCIA card.
- Editing data files in various formats, such as GSI, ASCII, DXF, LandXML and more.
- Converting data files between different formats and coordinate systems.
- Viewing data files in graphical or tabular mode.
- Printing data files or exporting them to other applications.
- Checking the unit settings of Geodimeter instruments, such as angle units, temperature units, atmospheric correction and more.

SP GST 2.02 can also work with GeoTool and GeoModel, which are variations of GST that can include digital terrain modelling capabilities. GeoTool and GeoModel require a Spectra Precision or Trimble Sentinel security key to run.
 
SP GST 2.02 is a useful software for Geodimeter users who want to manage their surveying data files easily and efficiently. However, it is not compatible with newer versions of Windows or newer models of Geodimeter instruments. For those users, Trimble Terramodel and Trimble Data Transfer Utility are recommended as alternatives.
